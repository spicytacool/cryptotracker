Follow these instruction here to install compiler and JDK https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/. 
Next take the code and paste into compiler.
Before running, add the json jar file and add it to classpaths.
This Crypto price tracker uses an array to give a list of crypto options for the API to track. 
Our API uses the JavaScript object notation (JSON) to represent the structure data it is exchanging, with the crypto API. 
The crypto API waits for the user to initiate a call that tells the application which crypto price to track, and the application will use the API to ask the web serves to check the current crypto price. 
Then the current price will be shown in the console. 
The user then could continue to track the same crypto currency or change it by running different numbers (each crypto has an assigned number assigned to it which will be displayed at the beginning).
